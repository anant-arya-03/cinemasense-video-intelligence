🎬 CinemaSense AI Studio

Multiverse Video Intelligence Platform

CinemaSense AI Studio is an advanced AI-powered video intelligence system that transforms a single video into multiple cinematic “universes” — Romantic, Thriller, and Viral — using automated scene understanding, emotion analysis, and intelligent editing logic.

The platform is designed to bridge the gap between creative filmmaking and AI-driven automation, making it suitable for research, content creators, and industry-level experimentation.

🚀 What Makes CinemaSense Different?

Unlike traditional video editors, CinemaSense does not just edit videos —
it understands them.

The system analyzes visual rhythm, emotional intensity, and scene transitions to generate explainable, purpose-driven edits, helping users understand why each cut, transition, or effect was chosen.
