1. Problem Statement

Background & Context

The making of video content has been at the heart of digital marketing, education, entertainment, and social media over the years. On the other hand, professional video editing consumes a lot of time, high-end tools, and a great deal of skill. A majority of the content creators find it difficult to change one video for various emotional contexts like romantic storytelling, thriller pacing, or viral short-form content.

Problem Importance
	•	Manual video editing is time-consuming and non-scalable
	•	Non-technical creators cannot easily produce professional edits
	•	Content must be repurposed across platforms with different emotional styles

AI Task Definition

The system performs AI-assisted video analysis and generation, including:
	•	Scene analysis
	•	Emotional rhythm detection
	•	Automated edit suggestions
	•	Multi-style video transformation

Objectives
	•	Automate professional video editing using AI
	•	Generate multiple emotionally-distinct versions of a single video
	•	Provide explainable editing decisions
	•	Deliver export-ready outputs with minimal user effort

Key Constraints & Assumptions
	•	Processing happens locally (privacy-preserving)
	•	Limited by video length and hardware resources
	•	No biometric or personal data extraction
	•	Ethical AI usage with full transparency

2. Approach

System Overview

CinemaSense AI Studio follows a pipeline-based architecture:
	1.	User uploads a video
	2.	Video is analyzed for scenes, motion, and emotional intensity
	3.	AI generates multiple “universes” (Romantic, Thriller, Viral)
	4.	Smart cuts, transitions, and effects are applied
	5.	Outputs are rendered and exported

Data Strategy
	•	Input: User-uploaded video files
	•	Processing: Frame extraction, motion analysis, scene boundaries
	•	No external datasets required
	•	Synthetic emotion scoring derived from visual patterns

AI / Model Design
	•	Rule-based + heuristic AI pipelines
	•	Emotion Rhythm Score (ERS) for pacing decisions
	•	Prompt-driven AI logic for explainability
	•	Modular design for future ML model integration

Tools & Technologies
	•	Python – Core logic
	•	Streamlit – Web interface
	•	MoviePy – Video processing
	•	OpenCV – Frame & motion analysis
	•	FFmpeg (imageio-ffmpeg) – Rendering backend
	•	NumPy, Pandas – Data handling
	•	Matplotlib – ERS visualization

Design Decisions
	•	Modular pipeline for scalability
	•	Local execution for privacy
	•	Streamlit for rapid UI iteration
	•	Explainability prioritized over black-box ML

3. Key Results

Working Prototype
	•	Fully functional Streamlit application
	•	Video upload → analysis → multiverse generation
	•	Downloadable outputs for each universe

Example Outputs
	•	Romantic edit with slower pacing and warm tones
	•	Thriller edit with rapid cuts and darker grading
	•	Viral edit optimized for short-form platforms

Evaluation Method
	•	Manual qualitative evaluation
	•	Visual pacing comparison
	•	Stability and runtime consistency

Performance Insights
	•	Handles standard MP4 inputs efficiently
	•	Pipeline modularity allows easy extension
	•	Real-time feedback improves usability

Known Limitations
	•	huge videos as the videos that are for eg big time span require more processing time
	•	Advanced ML emotion models not yet integrated
	•	GPU acceleration planned for future versions

4. Learnings

Technical Learnings
	•	Video processing pipelines
	•	Streamlit state management
	•	FFmpeg integration challenges
	•	Dependency isolation using virtual environments

System & Design Learnings
	•	Importance of modular architecture
	•	Error handling in production pipelines
	•	UX matters as much as AI logic

Challenges Faced
	•	Dependency conflicts (MoviePy, FFmpeg)
	•	Streamlit duplicate key issues
	•	Windows virtual environment management

Future Improvements
	•	Gesture-based editing control (MediaPipe)
	•	AI-generated thumbnails, titles & hashtags
	•	Gemini-powered AI editing assistant
	•	GPU-accelerated rendering
	•	Cloud deployment option
